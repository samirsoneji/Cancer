		<h2>Comparative Analyses</h2>
			<h3 id="psaRole">Quantifying the role of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening in U.S. prostate cancer mortality</h3>
                <p>The value of PSA screening remains uncertain. Even 
before randomized clinical trials on the potential benefits of PSA 
screening on prostate cancer mortality began, the test was rapidly 
adopted in several countries including the United States. However, while
 there is a general consensus that PSA screening explains much of the 
decline in the incidence of distant prostate cancers, there is still 
considerable debate about its role in the observed mortality decline. 
Two models were used to determine the plausible contribution of PSA 
screening in the decline of U.S. mortality. The researchers used common 
estimates of PSA screening rates and assumed that, by shifting the 
disease from a distant to a localized/regionalized clinical stage, 
screening does result in a corresponding improvement in disease-specific
 survival and mortality. The researchers concluded that PSA screening 
may account for much but not all of the observed reduction in prostate 
cancer mortality. Other factors, such as changing treatment practices, 
also may have played a role in improving prostate cancer outcomes (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18027095">Etzioni, Tsodikov 2008</a>).</p>

                    <p class="imgTitle">Prostate Cancer Mortality Rates: Results From Two CISNET Models</p>

U.S. observed PSA screening patterns (green).</p>

			<h3>Reconciling differing estimates of lead time and overdiagnosis due to PSA screening</h3>
                <p>Lead time and overdiagnosis are unobservable 
quantities that are key to evaluating the trade-offs between the 
potential benefits and harms of PSA screening. Previous studies, 
including two CISNET studies (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16397859">Tsodikov 2006</a>; <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12096083">Etzioni, Penson 2002</a>),
 published mean lead time estimates that ranged from 3 to 7 years and 
overdiagnosis estimates that ranged from 25% to 84% of all 
screen-detected cases. These prior estimates were highly disparate 
because they were developed under differing systems of practice of PSA 
use (e.g., PSA cutoffs and biopsy practices), different populations, as 
well as different assumptions and definitions of lead time and 
overdiagnosis. CISNET investigators seized this opportunity to bring 
order to this disparate literature by developing estimates using U.S. 
practice patterns and a consistent set of definitions. By standardizing 
in this manner, three CISNET modeling groups were able to dramatically 
reduce the range of estimates. The two major randomized trials of 
prostate cancer screening (PLCO and ERSPC) use considerably different 
PSA cutoff scores and biopsy practices. When the results of both these 
trials become available, this type of systematic modeling will be 
necessary to reconcile inevitable differences between the two trials and
 assist in translating them to public health guidelines for the use of 
PSA screening.</p>

			<h3>Explaining observed declines in prostate cancer mortality</h3>
                <p>Prostate cancer death rates have declined by more 
than one-third since the early 1990s. Many assume that PSA screening, 
which became popular in the early 1990s, is responsible for this drop in
 prostate cancer deaths. However, treatment for prostate cancer has also
 been changing. In the 1980s, radical prostatectomy increased in 
prominence, while, during the 1990s, hormonal therapies, previously 
reserved for advanced disease, were added to treatment regimens for 
localized tumors. This work aims to quantify the fraction of the 
mortality decline attributable to screening versus treatment. A previous
 study modeling only screening with two models showed that screening 
could plausibly account for 45-70% of the mortality decline. Three 
independently developed models of prostate cancer progression will be 
used in this study to determine whether treatment changes can account 
for the mortality decline not explained by screening, and similarly, 
whether screening can account for the mortality decline not explained by
 treatment. By isolating and quantifying the effects on mortality of 
treatment changes, we will be able to more clearly quantify the likely 
role of PSA screening, and to determine the likely benefits of PSA 
screening in the population setting.</p>
