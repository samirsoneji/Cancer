    Prostate Cancer: Stages

Approved by the Cancer.Net Editorial Board </about-us>, 10/2014

*ON THIS PAGE*: You will learn about how doctors describe a cancer’s
growth or spread. This is called the stage. To see other pages, use the
menu on the side of your screen.

Staging is a way of describing where the cancer is located, if or where
it has spread, and whether it is affecting other parts of the body.
Doctors use diagnostic tests to find out the cancer's stage, so staging
may not be complete until all of the tests are finished. Staging for
prostate cancer also involves looking at test results </node/19567> to
find out if the cancer has spread from the prostate to other parts of
the body. Knowing the stage helps the doctor to decide what kind of
treatment is best and can help predict a patient's prognosis, which is
the chance of recovery. There are different stage descriptions for
different types of cancer.

There are two types of staging for prostate cancer:

  * The clinical stage is based on the results of tests done before
    surgery, which includes DRE, biopsy, x-rays, CT and/or MRI scans,
    and bone scans. X-rays, bone scans, CT scans, and MRI scans may not
    always be needed. They are recommended based on the level of serum
    PSA; the size of the cancer, which includes its grade and volume;
    and the clinical stage of the cancer.
  * The pathologic stage is based on information found during surgery,
    plus the laboratory results, referred to as pathology, of the
    prostate tissue removed during surgery. The surgery often includes
    the removal of the entire prostate and some lymph nodes.

One tool that doctors use to describe the stage is the TNM system. TNM
is an abbreviation for tumor (T), node (N), and metastasis (M). Doctors
look at these three factors to determine the stage of cancer:

  * How large is the primary tumor and where is it located? *(Tumor, T) *
  * Has the tumor spread to the lymph nodes? *(Node, N)*
  * Has the cancer metastasized to other parts of the body?
    *(Metastasis, M)*

The results are combined to determine the stage of cancer for each
person. There are five stages: stage 0 (zero) and stages I through IV
(one through four). The stage provides a common way of describing the
cancer, so doctors can work together to plan the best treatments.

Here are more details about each part of the TNM system for prostate
cancer.*
*

*Tumor.* Using the TNM system, the "T" plus a letter or number (0 to 4)
is used to describe the size and location of the tumor. Some stages are
also divided into smaller groups that help describe the tumor in even
more detail. Specific tumor stage information is listed below.

*TX:* The primary tumor cannot be evaluated.

*T0:* There is no evidence of a tumor in the prostate.

*T1:* The tumor cannot be felt during a DRE and is not seen during
imaging, which is any test that produces pictures of the inside of the
body, such as a CT scan. It may be found when surgery is done for
another reason, usually for BPH or an abnormal growth of noncancerous
prostate cells.

*T1a:* The tumor is in 5% or less of the prostate tissue removed during
surgery.

*T1b:* The tumor is in more than 5% of the prostate tissue removed
during surgery.

*T1c:* The tumor is found during a needle biopsy, usually because the
patient has an elevated PSA level.

*T2:* The tumor is found only in the prostate, not other parts of the
body. It is large enough to be felt during a DRE.

*T2a:* The tumor involves one-half of one lobe (part or side) of the
prostate.

*T2b:* The tumor involves more than one-half of one lobe of the prostate
but not to both lobes.

*T2c:* The tumor has grown into both lobes of the prostate.

*T3:* The tumor has grown through the prostate capsule on one side into
the tissue just outside the prostate.

*T3a:* The tumor has grown through the prostate capsule either on one
side or on both sides of the prostate, or it has spread to the neck of
the bladder.

*T3b:* The tumor has grown into the seminal vesicle(s), the tube(s) that
carry semen.

*T4:* The tumor is fixed, or it is growing into nearby structures other
than the seminal vesicles, such as the external sphincter, the part of
the muscle layer that helps to control urination; the rectum; levator
muscles; and/or the pelvic wall.

*Nodes.* The “N” in the TNM staging system stands for lymph nodes, the
tiny, bean-shaped organs that help fight infection. Lymph nodes near the
prostate in the pelvic region are called regional lymph nodes. Lymph
nodes in other parts of the body are called distant lymph nodes.

*NX:* The regional lymph nodes cannot be evaluated.

*N0:* The cancer has not spread to the regional lymph nodes.

*N1:* The cancer has spread to the regional (pelvic) lymph node(s).

*Distant metastasis.* The "M" in the TNM system indicates whether the
prostate cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs
or the bones.

*MX: *Distant metastasis cannot be evaluated.

*M0:* The disease has not metastasized.

*M1:* There is distant metastasis.

*M1a:* The cancer has spread to nonregional, or distant, lymph node(s).

*M1b:* The cancer has spread to the bones.

*M1c:* The cancer has spread to another part of the body, with or
without spread to the bone.

*Cancer stage grouping*

Doctors assign the stage of the cancer by combining the T, N, and M
classification. See the table below the stage descriptions for all of
the TNM combinations for each stage.

*Stage I:* Cancer is found in the prostate only, usually during another
medical procedure. It cannot be felt during the DRE or seen on imaging
tests. A stage I cancer is usually made up of cells that look more like
healthy cells and is likely to grow slowly.

***Stage IIA and IIB:* This stage describes a tumor that is too small to
be felt or seen on imaging tests. Or, it describes a slightly larger
tumor that can be felt during a DRE. The cancer has not spread outside
of the prostate gland, but the cells are usually more abnormal and may
tend to grow more quickly. It has not spread to lymph nodes or distant
organs.

*Stage III:* The cancer has spread beyond the outer layer of the
prostate into nearby tissues. It may also have spread to the seminal
vesicles.

Stage I Prostate Cancer <#>

*Stage IV:* This stage describes any tumor that has spread to other
parts of the body, such as the bladder, rectum, bone, liver, lungs, or
lymph nodes.

Stage IV Prostate Cancer <#>

*Recurrent: *Recurrent prostate cancer is cancer that has come back
after treatment. It may come back in the prostate area again or in other
parts of the body. If there is a recurrence, the cancer may need to be
staged again (called re-staging) using the system above.

*Prognostic factors*

In addition to stage, doctors use other prognostic factors to help plan
the best treatment and predict how successful treatment will be. Below
are prognostic factors for men with prostate cancer.

*PSA test. *As described in the Risk Factors and Prevention
</node/19565> section, PSA is a measurement of prostate-specific antigen
levels in a man’s blood. These results are usually reported as nanograms
per milliliter (ng/mL), such as 7 ng/mL for a PSA level of 7. For men
already diagnosed with prostate cancer, the PSA level, as well as the
Gleason score, which is described below, helps the doctor understand and
predict a patient’s prognosis. This measurement gives doctors more
information about the cancer to help make treatment decisions. Some
prostate cancers do not cause an increased PSA level, so a normal PSA
does not always mean that there is no prostate cancer.

*Gleason score for grading prostate cancer**.* Prostate cancer is also
given a grade called a Gleason score, which is based on how much the
cancer looks like healthy tissue when viewed under a microscope. Less
dangerous tumors generally look more like healthy tissue, and more
dangerous tumors that are likely to grow and spread to other parts of
the body look less like healthy tissue.

The Gleason Scoring System is the most common prostate cancer grading
system used. The pathologist looks at how the cancer cells are arranged
in the prostate and assigns a score on a scale of 1 to 5. Cancer cells
that look similar to healthy cells are given a low score, and cancer
cells that look less like healthy cells or are more aggressive looking
are given a higher score. To assign the numbers, the doctor determines
the main pattern of cell growth, which is the area where the cancer is
most obvious, looks for any other less common pattern of growth, and
gives each one a score. The scores are added to come up with an overall
score between 2 and 10.

The interpretation of the Gleason score by doctors has changed recently.
Originally, doctors used a wide range of scores. Today, doctors no
longer use Gleason scores of 5 or lower for cancer found with a biopsy.
The lowest score used is 6, which is a low-grade cancer. A Gleason score
of 7 is a medium-grade cancer, and a score of 8, 9, or 10 is a
high-grade cancer. A lower-grade cancer grows more slowly and is less
likely to spread than a high-grade cancer.

Doctors look at the Gleason score in addition to stage to help plan
treatment. For example, active surveillance, described in the Treatment
Options </node/19569> section, may be an option for a patient with a
small tumor, low PSA level, and a Gleason score of 6. On the other hand,
patients with high Gleason score may need more intensive treatment even
if it does not appear that the cancer has spread.

*Gleason X:* The Gleason score cannot be determined.

*Gleason 6 or lower:* The cells are well differentiated.

*Gleason 7:* The cells are moderately differentiated.

*Gleason 8, 9, or 10:* The cells are poorly differentiated or
undifferentiated.

/Information about the cancer’s stage and other prognostic factors will
help the doctor recommend a treatment plan. The next section helps
explain the treatment options for this type of cancer. Use the menu on
