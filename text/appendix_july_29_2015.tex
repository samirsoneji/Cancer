% \begin{abstract}
% {\textbf{Background}.  US breast cancer mortality rates declined by 32\% since 1975, although the precise contributions of earlier detection and advancements in breast cancer treatment remain unknown.  We quantify the contributions of these two factors, as well as advancements in the treatment of other diseases, on gains in life expectancy among breast cancer patients.

% \textbf{Methods}.  We obtained annual incidence-based case fatality rates for 664,000 breast cancer patients aged 40 years and older from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries, 1975 to 2012.  We used life-table methods to calculate the gain in life expectancy and quantify the three constituent components of this gain: [1] earlier detection, [2] advancements in breast cancer treatment, and [3] advancements in the treatment of other diseases.  We additionally quantify which age groups contributed the most to the overall contribution of earlier detection.  We assumed a 10\% overdiagnosis level for tumors $\leq$3cm, and varied the level up to 32\% in a sensitivity analysis.

% \textbf{Results}.  Overall,  life expectancy increased 10.94 years between 1975 and 2002 for a 40-year old newly diagnosed breast cancer patient.  Advancements in breast cancer treatment contributed more to the gain in life expectancy than earlier detection: 6.79 years (62\%) versus 2.92 years (27\%).  Advancements in the treatment of other diseases contributed the remaining 1.25 years to this gain (11\%).  By age group, earlier detection among 40-49 year olds contributed more to the overall contribution of earlier detection (0.56 years) than 50-59 and 60-69 year olds (0.45 and 0.41 years, respectively).  We reached nearly identical substantive conclusions varying the level of overdiagnosis.

% \textbf{Conclusion}.  Life expectancy among breast cancer patients increased over time primarily because of advancements in breast cancer treatment, although the contribution of earlier detection was not trivial.}

\section{Computation of Incidence-Based Case Fatality Rates}
An incidence-based case fatality rate for a specific cohort of newly
diagnosed breast cancer patients equals the ratio of [1] the number of
deaths occurring for this cohort up to 10 years beyond their diagnosis
and [2] the total number of person-years lived by this cohort up to 10
years beyond their diagnosis.  For example, 556 women aged 65-69 years
were diagnosed with $<$1 cm breast cancer in 2001.  Between 2001 and
2011, 22 of these women died of breast cancer and another 107 died of
a competing cause of death.  This entire cohort lived a total of
5099.5 person-years over the 10-year period.  Thus, the
incidence-based case fatality rate from breast cancer equaled
22/5099.5 and the incidence-based case fatality rate from competing
causes of death equaled 107/5099.5.

\section{Adjustment for Overdiagnosis}
Suppose 10\% of the 556 women aged 65-69 years old diagnosed with <1cm
breast cancer in 2001 were overdiagnosed, the observed case fatality
rate from breast cancer (22/11,591) would become 22/[11,591 -
0.10*11,591].  Formally, let $\mathcal{A}$ be a set of age intervals
(e.g., 40-44 years, \dots, $\geq$100 years), $\mathcal{T}$ be a set of
years (e.g., 1975, \dots 2002), and $\mathcal{S}$ be a set of tumor
sizes at diagnosis(e.g., $<1$ cm, 1-2 cm, 2-3 cm, 3-5 cm, and 5+ cm).
Let $\alpha_s$ represent the assummed level of overdiagnosis for tumor
size $s\in\mathcal{S}$.  Let $m_{a,t,s}$ represent the observed case
fatality rate for age group $a \in \mathcal{A}$, year $t \in
\mathcal{T}$, and tumor size $s \in \mathcal{S}$.  Then, the case
fatality rate adjusted for overdiagnosis, $m^*_{a,t,s}$ equals,
$\frac{1}{1-\alpha_s} \times m_{a,t,s}$.

\section{Schematic Representation of the Methodology}
For simplicity, consider three mutually exclusive and exhaustive
categories of tumor size: 1, 2, and 3 (e.g., $<$1cm, 1-2cm, and
$\geq$2cm).  Suppose the distribution of tumor size at cancer
diagnosis remains constant between times 1 and 2
(Figure~\ref{fig:simple_case}, Panel A), tumor size-specific case
fatality rates from breast cancer decrease between times 1 and 2
(Figure~\ref{fig:simple_case}, Panel B), and tumor size-specific case
fatality rates from competing causes of death remain constant between
times 1 and 2 (Figure~\ref{fig:simple_case}, Panel B).  Tumor
size-specific life expectancy increases between times 1 and 2 because
tumor size-specific case fatality rates from breast cancer decreased
over the time period (Figure~\ref{fig:simple_case}, Panel C).  Overall
life expectancy at each time equals the weighted average of tumor
size-specific life expectancy, where the weights equal the
distribution of tumor sizes at cancer diagnosis at times 1 and 2,
respectively.  Overall life expectancy grew between times 1 and 2, and
this gain was entirely due to decreases in tumor size-specific case
fatality rates from breast cancer (Figure~\ref{fig:simple_case}, Panel
D).  In actuality, all three aforementioned factors change over time
and contribute to the gain in life expectancy.  We quantify the
individual contribution of each of these three constituent components.
We also utilize the same demographic method to further disaggregate
these three contributions by age group.

\section{Decomposition by Tumor Size and Case Fatality Rates from
  Breast Cancer and Other Causes of Death}
Let $\pi_s(t)$ and $e_s(a,t)$ be the proportion of patients and the
life expectancy for cancer patients with tumor size $s$,
at age $a$, and at time $t$. That is, $e_s(a,t)$ represents tumor size-specific life
expectancy. The overall life expectancy at age $a$ time $t$ is given
by
\begin{eqnarray}
  e(a,t)=\sum_{s\in\mathcal{S}}\,\pi_s(t)\,e_s(a,t) \notag
\end{eqnarray}
where $\sum_{s\in\mathcal{S}}\,\pi_s=1$. 

The change in life expectancy at age $a$ between times $t_1$ and $t_2$
by tumor sizes can be decomposed using the methodology of \cite{Kitagawa55}:
\begin{align}
  e(a,t_2)-e(a,t_1)&=\sum_{s\in\mathcal{S}}\left[\,\pi_s(t_2)\,e_s(a,t_2)- \pi_s(t_1)\,e_s(a,t_1)\right]  \notag\\
  \hspace{-0.7in} &=\sum_{s\in\mathcal{S}}\left[\pi_s(t_2)-\pi_s(t_1)
  \right]\left[\frac{e_s(a,t_1)+e_s(a,t_2)}{2}\right]+ \notag\\
  &\phantom{=}\sum_{s\in\mathcal{S}}\left[e_s(a,t_2)-e_s(a,t_1)
  \right]\left[\frac{\pi_s(t_1)+\pi_s(t_2)}{2}\right].
 \label{eqn:decomp.basic}
\end{align}
 
Equation~\ref{eqn:decomp.basic} quantifies how much of the change in life
expectancy at age $a$ between times $t_1$ and $t_2$ is due to: [a]
shifts in the share of cancer tumor size (first term) and [b] changes
in tumor-size-specific life expectancy (second term).

We can further decompose the second term of
equation~\ref{eqn:decomp.basic} by cause of death. In doing so, we can
quantify how much of this change in tumor-size-specific cancer life
expectancy, $e_s(a,t_2)-e_s(a,t_1)$, is due to improvements in cancer
mortality and competing causes of death.  Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a set
of mutually exclusive and exhaustive causes of death (e.g., breast
cancer and all other causes).  Let $L_{a,s,c}(t)$ represent the
person-years lived in the life table based on the case fatality rate
at age $a$, for tumor size $s$, from cause $c\in\mathcal{C}$, at time $t$.
Similarly, let $L_{a,s,-c}(t)$ represent the
person-years lived in the life table based on the case fatality rate
at age $a$, for tumor size $s$, and from causes other than $c$ ($-c$),
at time $t$.  Then, following the approach developed by \cite{BelPreCan08},
\begin{eqnarray}
e_s(a,t_2)-e_s(a,t_1)=\sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}} \sum_{a\in\mathcal{A}}\left[L_{a,s,c}(t_2)-L_{a,s,c}(t_1) \right] \left[\frac{L_{a,s,-c}(t_2)+L_{a,s,-c}(t_1) }{2n} \right],
\label{eqn:causedecomp}
\end{eqnarray}
where $n$ is the width of the age interval.

\textcolor{blue}{Samir: I don't think we can simplify the second summation by stating that $a\in\mathcal{A}$. The reason is that we are decomposition life exp at age $a$, so this summation must start at this age and end at $\omega$.  I think we need to use another letter to index the summation; something like
\begin{eqnarray}
e_s(a,t_2)-e_s(a,t_1)= \sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}}\sum_{x=a}^\omega \left[L_{x,s,c}(t_2)-L_{x,s,c}(t_1) \right] \left[\frac{L_{x,s,-c}(t_2)+L_{x,s,-c}(t_1) }{2n} \right] \notag
\end{eqnarray} }

We perform the decomposition starting at age 40; the final
decomposition equation equals:
\begin{align*}
  e(40,t_2)-e(40,t_1)&=\sum_{s\in\mathcal{S}}\left[\,\pi_s(t_2)\,e_s(40,t_2)- \pi_s(t_1)\,e_s(40,t_1)\right] \notag \\
                     &=\sum_{s\in\mathcal{S}}\left[\pi_s(t_2)-\pi_s(t_1) \right]\left[\frac{e_s(40,t_1)+e_s(40,t_2)}{2}\right]+\sum_{s\in\mathcal{S}}\left[\mathtt{Diff_e} \right]\left[\frac{\pi_s(t_1)+\pi_s(t_2)}{2}\right],
\end{align*}
where $\mathtt{Diff_e}$ is given by \eqref{eqn:causedecomp} evaluated at $a=40$.\\


\section{Decomposition by Tumor Size, Case Fatality Rates from
  Breast Cancer and Other Causes of Death, and Age Group}
Let $\pi_{s}(t)$ be the proportion of cancer patients with tumor size
$s$ in year $t$. This proportion can also be computed by age group
such that $\pi_s(t)=\sum_{a\in\mathcal{A}}\pi_{s,a}(t)$ and
$\sum_{s\in\mathcal{S}}\,\pi_s=1$.  Then, the
change in life expectancy at age $a$ between times $t_1$ and $t_2$ can
be estimated as:
\begin{align*}
  e(40,t_2)-e(40,t_1)&=\sum_{s\in\mathcal{S}}\left[\,\pi_s(t_2)\,e_s(40,t_2)- \pi_s(t_1)\,e_s(40,t_1)\right] \\
                     &=\sum_{s\in\mathcal{S}} \left[\sum_{a\in\mathcal{A}}\pi_{s,a}(t_2)\,e_s(40,t_2)- \sum_{a\in\mathcal{A}}\pi_{s,a}(t_1)\,e_s(40,t_1) \right]\\
                     &=\sum_{s\in\mathcal{S}}\left[\pi_{i,1}(t_2)\,e_s(40,t_2)-
                       \pi_{i,1}(t_1)\,e_s(40,t_1)\right] +\\
                     &\hspace{0.18in}\sum_{s\in\mathcal{S}}\left[\pi_{i,2}(t_2)\,e_s(40,t_2)- \pi_{i,2}(t_1)\,e_s(40,t_1)\right] + \\
  &\phantom{=\Sigma}\vdots \\
                     &\hspace{0.18in}\sum_{s\in\mathcal{S}}\left[\pi_{i,\left\vert\mathcal{A}\right\vert}(t_2)\,e_s(40,t_{\left\vert\mathcal{A}\right\vert})- \pi_{i,\left\vert\mathcal{A}\right\vert}(t_1)\,e_s(40,t_1)\right]. \notag 
 \end{align*}


 Each summation in the above equation can be written as follows based
 on equation \eqref{eqn:decomp.basic}:
\begin{multline}
  e(40,t_2)-e(40,t_1)= \\
  \sum_{s\in\mathcal{S}}\left[\pi_{i,1}(t_2)-\pi_{i,1}(t_1) \right]\left[\frac{e_s(40,t_1)+e_s(40,t_2)}{2}\right]+\sum_{s\in\mathcal{S}}\left[e_s(40,t_2)-e_s(40,t_1) \right]\left[\frac{\pi_{i,1}(t_1)+\pi_{i,1}(t_2)}{2}\right] +\\
  \sum_{s\in\mathcal{S}}\left[\pi_{i,2}(t_2)-\pi_{i,2}(t_1) \right]\left[\frac{e_s(40,t_1)+e_s(40,t_2)}{2}\right]+\sum_{s\in\mathcal{S}}\left[e_s(40,t_2)-e_s(40,t_1) \right]\left[\frac{\pi_{i,2}(t_1)+\pi_{i,2}(t_2)}{2}\right] +\\
  \vdots \\
  \sum_{s\in\mathcal{S}}\left[\pi_{i,{\left\vert\mathcal{A}\right\vert}}(t_2)-\pi_{i,{\left\vert\mathcal{A}\right\vert}}(t_1) \right]\left[\frac{e_s(40,t_1)+e_s(40,t_2)}{2}\right]+\sum_{s\in\mathcal{S}}\left[e_s(40,t_2)-e_s(40,t_1) \right]\left[\frac{\pi_{i,{\left\vert\mathcal{A}\right\vert}}(t_1)+\pi_{i,{\left\vert\mathcal{A}\right\vert}}(t_2)}{2}\right] =\\
  \sum_{s\in\mathcal{S}}\left[\mathtt{Diff_{\pi,1}} \right]\mathtt{\bar{e}_i} + \sum_{s\in\mathcal{S}}\left[\mathtt{Diff_{\pi,2}} \right]\mathtt{\bar{e}_i} + 
  \dots +
 \sum_{s\in\mathcal{S}}\left[\mathtt{Diff_{\pi,{\left\vert\mathcal{A}\right\vert}}} \right]\mathtt{\bar{e}_i} +\sum_{s\in\mathcal{S}}\left[e_s(40,t_2)-e_s(40,t_1)\right]\left[\frac{\pi_s(t_1)+\pi_s(t_2)}{2}\right]
\label{agedec}
\end{multline}
where $\mathtt{Diff_{\pi,a}}=\pi_{s,a}(t_2)-\pi_{s,a}(t_1)$ and $\mathtt{\bar{e}_i}=\frac{e_s(40,t_1)+e_s(40,t_2)}{2}$.

The first $\left\vert\mathcal{A}\right\vert$ terms of equation
\eqref{agedec} (the terms based on $\mathtt{Diff_{\pi,1}}$ through
$\mathtt{Diff_{\pi,{\left\vert\mathcal{A}\right\vert}}}$) correspond
to the contribution of changes in the share of tumor size by age group
to changes in cancer life expectancy between times $t_1$ and $t_2$. We
can additionally estimate the contribution of cancer-specific
mortality rates to changes in tumor-size-specific life expectancy by
age. The last term of \eqref{agedec} can be written as follows, based
on equation \eqref{eqn:causedecomp}:
%\begin{align}
%  e_s(40,t_2)-e_s(40,t_1)&=\sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}} \sum_{a=40}^{49}\left[L_{a,s,c}(t_2)-L_{a,s,c}(t_1) \right] \left[\frac{L_{a,s,-c}(t_2)+L_{a,s,-c}(t_1) }{2n} \right] + \notag\\
%  &\phantom{=}\sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}} \sum_{a=50}^{59}\left[L_{a,s,c}(t_2)-L_{a,s,c}(t_1) \right] \left[\frac{L_{a,s,-c}(t_2)+L_{a,s,-c}(t_1) }{2n} \right] + \notag\\
%  &\phantom{=  .}\vdots \notag\\
%  &\phantom{=}\sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}} \sum_{a=100}^{\omega}\left[L_{a,s,c}(t_2)-L_{a,s,c}(t_1) \right] \left[\frac{L_{a,s,-c}(t_2)+L_{a,s,-c}(t_1) }{2n} \right] .
%\end{align}
%
%\textcolor{blue}{Hiram -- Can we write equation E.2 like this?  The last term of \eqref{agedec} can be written as follows, based

\end{align}
\textcolor{blue}{Samir: Same comment as above, I don't think we can simplify the second summation by stating that $a\in\mathcal{A}$. This summation must start at age 40 and end at $\omega$.  I suggest we write it as

\section{Assuming Constant Mortality Within Age Intervals}
Let $M_{a,a+n}$ represent the mortality rate between ages $a$ and
$a+n$. Then, \textcolor{blue}{we can estimate the life table survivors at age $a+n$ as (Preston et al. 2001)}
\begin{equation}
l_{a+n}=e^{-\int_a^{a+n}\mu(x)\,dx}=e^{-n\,M_{a,a+n}}.\notag
\end{equation}
\textcolor{blue}{where $\mu(x)$ represents the risk of death at age $x$.}


We can then estimate the person-years lived between ages $a$ and $a+n$
as
\begin{equation}
_nL_{a}=l_a\,\int_a^{a+n} e^{-M_{a,a+n}(s-a)} ds=l_a \left(\frac{-1}{M_{a,a+n}}(e^{-n\,M_{a,a+n}}-1) \right).
\label{Lx}
\end{equation}
If, for example, age intervals are 5 years wide, equation \eqref{Lx}
equals
\begin{equation}
_5L_{a}=l_a \left(\frac{-1}{M_{a,a+5}}(e^{-5\,M_{a,a+5}}-1) \right).\notag
\end{equation}
For the last age group (e.g., $\geq$100 years), we can assume there
are no person-years lived beyond a certain time (say no more than 10
years) to compute $_+L_{100}$ as
\begin{equation}
_+L_{100}=l_{100} \left(\frac{-1}{M_{100+}}(e^{-10\,M_{100+}}-1) \right).\notag
\end{equation}

%Consider tumor size $i$.  The change
%in life expectancy at age $x$ between times $t_1$ and $t_2$ can be
%decomposed as (Kitigawa 1955): 
%\begin{equation}
% e_s(x,t_2)-e_s(x,t_1) = \sum_{j=1}^k \int_x^\infty \left[ p_{i,j}(s,t_2)- p_{i,j}(s,t_1)\right] \left[ \frac{p_{i,-j}(s,t_1)+p_{i,-j}(s,t_2)}{2} \right]\,ds, \notag
%\end{equation}
%where $p_{i,j}(s,t)$ is the probability of surviving from birth to age
%$s$ for cancer patients with tumor size $i$ cause $j$ at time $t$, and
%$p_{i,-j}(s,t)$ is the analogue survival probability for competing
%causes of death (other than $j$).
