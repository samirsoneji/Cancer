                        (a.k.a. associated life tables)
cause.decomp-package    It estimates the contribution of changes in
                        cause-specific mortality rates on changes in
                        life expectancy between two time periods using
                        the methodology developed by Beltrán-Sánchez et
                        al. (2008). It also produces two life tables,
                        one for each time period.
